# Basic Styling with Tailwind

## Objective:

```

This will first install necessary dependencies and then run the project and check for changes in your code. If you open your live server you'll see that youre Tailwind Changes apply.

2. You can find a PDF file `Tailwind Showcase.pdf` with a model image that shows the final result you need to achieve. You'll find it under `assets` folder.
